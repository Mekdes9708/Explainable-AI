## 📂 NLP Project: Explainable AI for Medical Text
### 📜 Project Overview
This project explores the explainability of AI models applied to medical text, specifically pathology reports. We compare Logistic Regression and BioBERT in terms of both predictive performance and interpretability using SHAP and T5.

### 📊 Methodology
- **Dataset:** TCGA pathology reports (processed and anonymized).
- **Models:** Logistic Regression (baseline), BioBERT (deep learning model).
- **Explainability Tools:** SHAP (feature-level explanations), T5 (textual justifications).

### 🏆 Results & Insights
- BioBERT achieves higher accuracy than Logistic Regression but requires advanced interpretability methods.
- SHAP highlights key terms influencing predictions.
- T5 generates human-readable explanations for AI decisions.
